The curried function has two unusual capabilities. First, its\n * arguments needn't be provided one at a time. If `g` is `R.curryN(3, f)`, the\n * following are equivalent:\n *\n *   - `g(1)(2)(3)`\n *   - `g(1)(2, 3)`\n *   - `g(1, 2)(3)`\n *   - `g(1, 2, 3)`\n *\n * Secondly, the special placeholder value `R.__` may be used to specify\n * \"gaps\", allowing partial application of any combination of arguments,\n * regardless of their positions. If `g` is as above and `_` is `R.__`, the\n * following are equivalent:\n *\n *   - `g(1, 2, 3)`\n *   - `g(_, 2, 3)(1)`\n *   - `g(_, _, 3)(1)(2)`\n *   - `g(_, _, 3)(1, 2)`\n *   - `g(_, 2)(1)(3)`\n *   - `g(_, 2)(1, 3)`\n *   - `g(_, 2)(_, 3)(1)`\n *\n * @func\n * @memberOf R\n * @since v0.5.0\n * @category Function\n * @sig Number -> (* -> a) -> (* -> a)\n * @param {Number} length The arity for the returned function.\n * @param {Function} fn The function to curry.\n * @return {Function} A new, curried function.\n * @see R.curry\n * @example\n *\n *      var sumArgs = (...args) => R.sum(args);\n *\n *      var curriedAddFourNumbers = R.curryN(4, sumArgs);\n *      var f = curriedAddFourNumbers(1, 2);\n *      var g = f(3);\n *      g(4); //=> 10\n */\nmodule.exports = _curry2(function curryN(length, fn) {\n  if (length === 1) {\n    return _curry1(fn);\n  }\n  return _arity(length, _curryN(length, [], fn));\n});\n\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/flyd/~/ramda/src/curryN.js\n// module id = 791\n// module chunks = 0","var _curry1 = require('./_curry1');\nvar _isPlaceholder = require('./_isPlaceholder');\n\n\n/**\n * Optimized internal two-arity curry function.\n *\n * @private\n * @category Function\n * @param {Function} fn The function to curry.\n * @return {Function} The curried function.\n */\nmodule.exports = function _curry2(fn) {\n  return function f2(a, b) {\n    switch (arguments.length) {\n      case 0:\n        return f2;\n      case 1:\n        return _isPlaceholder(a) ?
